# PhysicsEngine

The implementation of this physics engine is influenced by the following libraries:
* tiny_cuda_nn.
* pbr
* project chrono

## Physical Rendering [Light physics]

### TO DO

[ ] implement quaternions
[ ] implement refernce abstract class
[ ] update the documentation as well as add class notes to the repo to follow

### Current Milestones

-[ ] Implement the linear transformations

> -[ ] implement vector definition

> -[ ] Implementmatrix definition

> -[ ] Implement quaternions

> -[ ] Implement HTM

> -[ ] Implement rotation dyads calculations

> -[ ] Test the code

-[ ] Implement static reference frames

> -[ ] implement tracing the frames to get their resolution in global frame

> -[ ] test the frame resolution in cuda for a large number of random frames

-[ ] Implement different camera models in PBRT

-[ ] Implement a simple ray tracing engine

> -[ ] combine the engine with the previous code

> -[ ] add some gui to control it.

> -[ ] add rendering result directly to gui.
