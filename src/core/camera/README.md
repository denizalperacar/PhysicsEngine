In this folder different camera models are implemented to be used in rendering, ray marching and tomographic reconstruction.

The camera model implemented in the notes at [ray tracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html). 
This camera will be modified to be compatible with PE.
